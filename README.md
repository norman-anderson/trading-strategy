# Stock Trading Using Reinforcement Learner
In this project my goal was to come up with a stock trading strategy based on a stock's scores using technical indicators. 

Feeding these technical indicator scores to my model-free Reinforcement "Q-learner", I was able to produce a trading strategy that outperformed my benchmark by %30.
